Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: as I increased the number of simulations
from 1000 till 1000000 the distribution hasn't changed

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
