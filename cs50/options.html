        oftentimes we are not aware of the emotions we are experiencing during the day.
        oftentimes this happens too often.
        the goal of this moodprint is to reflect your inner state and widen your focus.

        that's totally up to you how to use it.
        maybe you'll get to notice some patterns or maybe you'll learn a bit more about yourself.



         enjoy this journey of self-knowledge.
